(1) Identified Design Smells: 
- Null Object: The "getId()" and "getEmail()" methods return null, which is a smell as null values can lead to NullPointerExceptions.
- Missing Abstraction: There's no encapsulation for the "locale" and "dateTimeZone" fields, exposing them directly through setters.
- Data Class: Class only contains data fields and accessor methods with no significant behavior.

(2) Suggested Refactoring:
- For the Null Object issue, implement the Null Object pattern. Create a class that implements the IPrincipal interface, providing default behaviour for "getId()" and "getEmail()" methods.
- For the Missing Abstraction issue, remove setters for "locale" and "dateTimeZone" and pass these values via the constructor or methods where they're needed.
- To correct the Data Class smell, move any relevant behavior related to the "AnonymousPrincipal" itself into the class, such as locale and timezone handling functionalities.
